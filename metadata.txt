# more detailed description:
about=This QGIS plugin brings precipitation data from German Meteorological Service (DWD, https://www.dwd.de) - radar data in RADOLAN/RADKLIM binary format in any grid dimension as well as REGNIE - on a map  
  You also can **add** up RADOLAN data!  
  Applications: hydrometeorological and agricultural analyses.  
  
  RADOLAN overview: https://dwd.de/RADOLAN  
  RADOLAN data (recent): https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/hourly/radolan/recent/bin  
  RADKLIM data (radar climatology): https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/hourly/radolan/reproc/2017_002/bin  
  
  A RADOLAN-RW-testfile (gzipped binary) is included in directory 'example/sample_file/'.
  
  The plugin was successfully tested with QGIS 3.10 "A Coruña"  
  on Windows 10, Linux openSUSE 15.1  
    
  Please restart QGIS after updating the plugin!
