# more detailed description:
about=This QGIS plugin brings precipitation radar data from German Meteorological Service (DWD, https://www.dwd.de) in RADOLAN/RADKLIM binary format in any grid dimension as well as REGNIE on a map  
  You also can **add** up RADOLAN data!  
  Applications: hydrometeorological and agricultural analyses.  
  
  RADOLAN overview: https://dwd.de/RADOLAN  
  RADOLAN data (recent): https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/hourly/radolan/recent/bin  
  RADKLIM data (radar climatology): https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/hourly/radolan/reproc/2017_002/bin  
  Radar products on DWD Open Data: https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/radar/composit/  
  
  A RADOLAN-RW-testfile (gzipped binary) is included in directory 'example/sample_file/'.

  The plugin was successfully tested with
  - QGIS 3.18 on Windows 10
  - QGIS 3.36 Linux openSUSE Tumbleweed

  Please restart QGIS after updating the plugin!

changelog=
  1.8, 2024-04-21:
    * Functionality
      - allow multiselect in RADOLAN load tab
      - automatically layer grouping (day), collapsed
      - reduced log output for performance reason
    * fix
      - temporal settings (after project reload; UTC error?)
  1.7, 2023-01-23: 
    * Functionality - new products: display of the
      - HG product (precipitation type): https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/radar/composit/hg/
      - WN product (reflectivity product): https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/radar/composit/wn/
      - bzip2 format is now readable directly ('HG'), not 'tar.bz2' ('WN')
    * Projection
      - ASCIIGridWriter: added projection for WN (lower left corner)
      - added projection for stereographic projection based on WGS ellipsoid (POLARA products)
    * correction: german radar network: radius 150 km
  1.6, 2021-12-04: 
    - REGNIE files are now converted to GeoTIFF rasters instead of CSV
  1.5, 2021-02-26: Bugfix version
    - ### bug fixed that prevents defining the data dir ###
    - fixed a possible bug at RADOLAN adding (handling of NaN values)
    - optimization: RADOLAN adder file access: no glob for every file any more
    - display of new features, which is presented to the user once
  1.4, 2020-12-26: Christmas gift: "radolan summation version"
    - in a separate tab you can now generate a sum product based on individual RADOLAN files!
    - revised handling of 'interval unit' to assign the proper QML color scale
    - redesign of internal processes (tasks per tab)
    - the last used processing tab is saved (will be shown on the next run)
    - you can define your own logo in 'config.ini' for usage in print layout
  1.3, 2020-05-21: "print layout version"
    - print layout implemented
    - catch global exception, show it to the user as a window
    - catch exception at reading corrupted RADOLAN bin file and show this in GUI window
    - links to REGNIE download site included
    - layer storage folder reorganized - root and data dir
    - separate subdirectories for the different data types: 'regnie', 'radolan', 'radklim'
  1.2, 2020-01-24: "REGNIE version"
    - from now 'radolan2map' can load REGNIE raster files (daily, monthly, yearly)  
      but the support is rudimentary (data is displayed as point layer)
    - new button which loads DWDs radar network from layer definition file (qlr)
  1.1, 2019-12-10:
    - current DWD radar network in template project included
    - combo box for selection of destination projection
    - settings are saved
